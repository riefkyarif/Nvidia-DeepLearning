    "The Problem: Image Classification\n",
    "In traditional programming, the programmer is able to articulate rules and conditions in their code that their program can then use to act in the correct way. This approach continues to work exceptionally well for a huge variety of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image classification, which asks a program to correctly classify an image it has never seen before into its correct class, is near impossible to solve with traditional programming techniques. How could a programmer possibly define the rules and conditions to correctly classify a huge variety of images, especially taking into account images that they have never seen?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Solution: Deep Learning\n",
    "Deep learning excels at pattern recognition by trial and error. By training a deep neural network with sufficient data, and providing the network with feedback on its performance via training, the network can identify, though a huge amount of iteration, its own set of conditions by which it can act in the correct way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MNIST Dataset\n",
    "In the history of deep learning, the accurate image classification of the MNIST dataset, a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, was a major development. While today the problem is considered trivial, doing image classification with MNIST has become a kind of \"Hello World\" for deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are 40 of the images included in the MNIST dataset:\n",
    "\n",

    "Training and Validation Data and Labels\n",
    "When working with images for deep learning, we need both the images themselves, usually denoted as X, and also, correct labels for these images, usually denoted as Y. Furthermore, we need X and Y values both for training the model, and then, a separate set of X and Y values for validating the performance of the model after it has been trained. Therefore, we need 4 segments of data for the MNIST dataset:\n",

    "y_valid: Correct labels for the x_valid images, used to evaluate the model's predictions after it has been trained\n",

    "Loading the Data Into Memory (with Keras)\n",
    "There are many deep learning frameworks, each with their own merits. In this workshop we will be working with Tensorflow 2, and specifically with the Keras API. Keras has many useful built in functions designed for the computer vision tasks. It is also a legitimate choice for deep learning in a professional setting due to its readability and efficiency, though it is not alone in this regard, and it is worth investigating a variety of frameworks when beginning a deep learning project.\n",

    "Categorical Encoding\n",

However, for this image classification problem, we don't want the neural network to learn this kind of reasoning: we just want it to select the correct category, and understand that if we have an image of the number 5, that guessing 4 is just as bad as guessing 9.\n",
