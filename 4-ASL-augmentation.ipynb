    "Data Augmentation\n",
    "So far, we've selected a model architecture that vastly improves the model's performance, as it is designed to recognize important features in the images. The validation accuracy is still lagging behind the training accuracy, which is a sign of overfitting: the model is getting confused by things it has not seen before when it tests against the validation dataset.\n",

    "In order to teach our model to be more robust when looking at new data, we're going to programmatically increase the size and variance in our dataset. This is known as data augmentation, a useful technique for many deep learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
