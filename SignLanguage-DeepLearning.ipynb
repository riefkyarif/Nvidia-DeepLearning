    "In the previous section, we built and trained a simple model to classify ASL images. The model was able to learn how to correctly classify the training dataset with very high accuracy, but, it did not perform nearly as well on validation dataset. This behavior of not generalizing well to non-training data is called overfitting, and in this section, we will introduce a popular kind of model called a convolutional neural network that is especially good for reading images and classifying them.\n",
